class Gradle { //todo
    // Since lesson 1 we've been using Gradle.
    // So, you think you know gradle?

    //todo p1
    // In your words (do not use wiki definitions)
    // What is gradle?
    // Answer: Dependency management thing that helps us building jar file with all libraries it need in order to work

    //todo p2
    // What is gradle wrapper? Why are we using it instead of gradle?
    // Answer: Its a script that makes sure that if person who downloaded the project doesn't have required version of
    // gradle will get it downloaded and that the person can run the project right out of the box without changing anything himself

    //todo p3
    // Name at least 1 alternative to gradle
    // Apache Ant, Maven

    //todo p4
    // Name 3 different benefits or reasons for using gradle
    // * Much more flexible, in gradle you write groovy or kotlin code that allows you to do pretty much everything,
    // I have even made voice alert for build steps on my projects
    // * Its faster, no idea what is behind that but had similar projects on those 2 and gradle was making things done sometimes even 50% faster
    // * Much better support for multimodule projects, it is possible to do in Maven but its messy hell.
