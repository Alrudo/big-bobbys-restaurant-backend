    // In your words (do not use wiki definitions)
    // What is abstraction? (P.S It has nothing to do with keyword abstract)
    // Answer: A cool thing of the OOP, the point is to simplify usage of some complicated structures/algorithms, by creating some
    // interfaces that leaves some easy to use methods for user, while passing all the job to a complex black box. REST API endpoints are
    // good example, the end user does not need to know what are those endpoints doing, all he needs is knowledge what is required and what is returned

    //todo p2
    // Create an abstraction of an animal of your choice.
    // It should have at least 1 property and 1 method.
    // Create it as a real java class inside this package.
